# Banking System

A collaborative PHP and MySQL project built during my third year at **SETU Carlow**. The system simulates a simple online banking platform with multiple user-facing and administrative features.

## Features
- **User Authentication** – register, log in, and manage account securely.
- **Accounts & Transactions** – view balances, transfer money between accounts, and track transaction history.
- **Admin Panel** – manage users and review transactions.
- **Responsive UI** – redesigned ~50% of the screens for improved usability and modern design.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP 
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## My Contributions
This was a team project. My main contributions included:
- Forked the repository and redesigned **~50% of all UI screens** for a cleaner and more user-friendly experience.
- Improved navigation, consistency of layout, and visual styling.
- Collaborated with teammates on GitHub using branches and pull requests.
- Built and designed the lodgements and add, delete, and amend/view a customer screens.
